App structure
    PublicApp

    Still not sure about this, I wanted to make one to one relationship app+controller+view, but contect switching could get messy if I needed sesison data, how to pass session data or make a global
    
    The reason I don't like One App + One Controller + multiple views is all the event handling and methods. How will I keep them separate/clean. It was easier having one controller+view have a single responsibility
    
Controller structure
    Routes : Handles navigation, such as between pages and controllers (login logout)
